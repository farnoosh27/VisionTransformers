## Shared Components

The architecture of the original transformer used in NLP tasks and that of the Vision Transformer (ViT) used in computer vision tasks share many fundamental components, but there are also important differences to accommodate the distinct characteristics of text and images. Here's a breakdown of the similarities and differences:

### Self-Attention Mechanism

Both transformers and ViTs utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships and dependencies between different elements in the input data. This mechanism is essential for understanding context and associations.

### Multi-Head Attention

Both architectures employ multi-head attention, allowing the model to capture various types of relationships and nuances in the data.

### Positional Encoding

Both transformers and ViTs utilize positional encodings to provide information about the order or position of elements in the sequence. These encodings help the model understand the sequential or spatial relationships.

### Feedforward Neural Networks

Both architectures include feedforward neural networks to process the outputs of the attention mechanisms and generate refined representations.

## Differences
### Input Data

- **Transformer:** In NLP, the input data comprises sequences of words or tokens, which are often sequential and linguistically structured.
- **ViT:** In computer vision, the input data consists of images, which are inherently spatial and lack linguistic structure.

### Embeddings

- **Transformer:** For NLP, word embeddings are commonly used to represent words as dense vectors. These embeddings capture semantic meaning.
- **ViT:** For images, patches are flattened and linearly embedded, converting them into input representations.

### Positional Encodings

- **Transformer:** NLP positional encodings account for word order in sequential data.
- **ViT:** Image positional encodings convey spatial relationships between patches.

### Contextual Relationships

- **Transformer:** In NLP, the model learns contextual relationships between words, capturing linguistic dependencies.
- **ViT:** In computer vision, the model learns contextual relationships between image patches, capturing spatial context.

### Output Layer

- **Transformer:** In NLP, the final output layer depends on the task, such as classification or generation.
- **ViT:** In computer vision, the final output layer is often a classification layer due to image classification tasks.

While both transformers and ViTs have a common foundation, they adapt their architecture to accommodate the unique characteristics of text and images, respectively. The utilization of similar components allows ViTs to process images effectively using the transformer framework, while accommodating the specific properties of visual data.
